# Contributing to Haystack Tutorials

A contribution to Haystack tutorials may be anything from a suggestion for edits or a new tutorial request to adding a new tutorial or editing an existing one yourself.

To make a request for a new tutorial or to suggest edits and fixes, submit an issue and choose the appropriate type:

- **Bug  report:** For any edit suggestions or bug reports.

- **New Tutorial Request ðŸ““:** To suggest that we create a new tutorial.

## Contributing Edits or New Tutorials

All of the Haystack tutorials live in the `tutorials` folder in this repo. Each tutorial is an interactive `.ipynb` file and we generate a Markdown file to accompany it.

Here's what you need to do to add or edit tutorials ðŸ‘‡:

1. Prepare your environment:
   - Install the Python requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Install the pre-commit hooks with `pre-commit install`. This utility will run some formatting/checking
   tasks right before all git commit operations.
2. If you're **creating** a new tutorial:
   - Create a copy of [tutorial template](/tutorials/template.ipynb) in `/tutorials` folder.
   - Rename the new `.ipynb` file by following the [naming convention](#naming-convention-for-file-names).
   - Follow the outline in the template as you create the tutorial.
   - After the tutorial is complete, add necessary information to [index.toml](/index.toml). Here, `weight` is the order in which your tutorial appears. For example, a tutorial with `weight = 15` comes after a tutorial with `weight = 10` and before `20`. Each tutorial comes with a Google Colab link and `Open in Colab` button on the top of the tutorial by default. If your new tutorial cannot be run on Google Colab, set `colab = false` not to display `Open in Colab` button on top the tutorial.
3. If you're **editing** an existing tutorial:
   - Make necessary changes in the `.ipynb` file of the tutorial and save them.
4. Create a pull request.
5. Wait for the [CI](#ci-continuous-integration) checks to pass.
6. Update the [README](./README.md), if necessary.
7. Wait for a review and merge ðŸŽ‰. Thank you for contributing ðŸ’™.

## Slugs

By default, the name of each tutorial becomes the slug of its page on the website. For example, "01_Basic_QA_Pipeline" will be on https://haystack.deepset.ai/tutorials/01_basic_qa_pipeline.

In `index.toml`,  you can optionally add a `slug` entry for a tutorial to use a custom slug. Adding a slug is also useful if you're updating a tutorial to the point where it makes sense for the name of the `.ipynb` file to change, but you still want people to access the tutorial under the same URL.

# Continuous Integration (CI)

We use a GitHub action for our Continuous Integration tasks. This means that as soon as you open a PR, GitHub starts executing some workflows on your code. Here, the workflow checks whether the tutorial you created or edited runs without an error.

If all goes well, at the bottom of your PR page, you should see something like this, where all checks are green.

If you see some red checks, then something didn't work and you need to take some action. Please check the tutorial again and fix the errors.

# Naming Convention for File Names

- Each tutorial name starts with a number. If you create a new tutorial, its name should start with the number following the last tutorial. 
- Separate words in the title with an `_` underscore.
- Use a short descriptive name for the filename, for example: *22_creating_a_summarizer_pipeline*.
