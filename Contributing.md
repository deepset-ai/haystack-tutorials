# Contributing to Haystack Tutorials

All of the Haystack tutorials live in the `tutorials` folder in this repo. Each tutorial is an interactive `.ipynb` file that can be ran on Google Colab too. Follow the steps below to add or edit the tutorials ðŸ‘‡

1. Prepare your environment:
   - Install requirements with `pip install requirements.txt`
   - Install the pre-commit hooks with `pre-commit install`. This utility will run some formatting/checking
   tasks right before all git commit operations.
2. Please make sure to follow the [naming convention](#naming-convention) for file names.
3. Make any changes (editing an existing tutorial or creating a new one) in the `/tutorials` folder by editing or creating `.ipynb` files.
4. Update the `markdowns` folder to reflect the changes:
    - Run `python /scripts/generate_markdowns.py`
    - This will generate or update the relevant markdown file in `/markdowns`
5. Create a Pull Request
6. Wait for the [CI](#ci-continuous-integration) checks to pass
    - These checks will pass if the relevant markdown files have been created
7. Update the [README](./README.md) if necessary.
8. Wait for a review and merge ðŸŽ‰ Thank you for contributing ðŸ’™


# CI (Continuous Integration)

We use GitHub Action for our Continuous Integration tasks. This means that, as soon as you open a PR, GitHub will start executing some workflows on your code. Here, the workflow will check that you've generated the required `.md` file for the tutorial(s) you've edited or created.

If all goes well, at the bottom of your PR page you should see something like this, where all checks are green.

If you see some red checks, then something didn't work, and action is needed from your side. This is most likely because you haven't updated or created the required `.md` file to accompany the tutorial that you've created or changed. 

# Naming Convention

- Each tutorial starts with its number
- Separate words with an `_` underscore
- Use a short descriptive name for the filename
- Generated markdown files only have the number of the tutorial (use the `scripts/generate_markdowns.py` script for this)
