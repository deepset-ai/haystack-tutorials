# Contributing to Haystack Tutorials

A contribution to Haystack tutorials may be anything from a suggestion for edits or a new tutorial request to adding a new tutorial or editing an existing one yourself.

To make a request for a new tutorial or to suggest edits and fixes, submit an issue and choose the appropriate type:

- **Bug  report:** For any edit suggestions or bug reports.

- **New Tutorial Request ðŸ““:** To suggest that we create a new tutorial.

## Contributing Edits or New Tutorials

All of the Haystack tutorials live in the `tutorials` folder in this repo. Each tutorial is an interactive `.ipynb` file that you can run on Google Colab, too. For each `.ipynb` file, we also generate a Markdown file to accompany it.

Here's what you need to do to add or edit tutorials ðŸ‘‡:

1. Prepare your environment:
   - Install the Python requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Install the pre-commit hooks with `pre-commit install`. This utility will run some formatting/checking
   tasks right before all git commit operations.
2. If you're creating a new tutorial:
   - Follow the [naming convention](#naming-convention-for-file-names) for file names.
   - Add your new tutorial to [index.toml](/index.toml). Here, `weight` is the order in which your tutorial appears. For example, a tutorial with `weight = 15` comes after a tutorial with `weight = 10` and before `20`.
3. Edit an existing tutorial or copy the [tutorial template](/tutorials/template.ipynb) to create a new tutorial. 
4. Pre-commit hooks will ensure the `markdowns` folder reflects your changes but you can update the docs at any time:
    - Run `python scripts/generate_markdowns.py --index index.toml --notebooks tutorials/your-tutorial.ipynb --output markdowns/`. This generates or updates the relevant markdown file in `/markdowns`.
5. Create a pull request.
6. Wait for the [CI](#ci-continuous-integration) checks to pass.
   These checks pass if the relevant markdown files are created.
7. Update the [README](./README.md), if necessary.
8. Wait for a review and merge ðŸŽ‰. Thank you for contributing ðŸ’™.


# Continuous Integration (CI)

We use a GitHub action for our Continuous Integration tasks. This means that as soon as you open a PR, GitHub starts executing some workflows on your code. Here, the workflow checks that you've generated the required `.md` files for the tutorials you've edited or created.

If all goes well, at the bottom of your PR page, you should see something like this, where all checks are green.

If you see some red checks, then something didn't work and you need to take some action. The most likely reason is that the `.md` file accompanying the `.ipynb` tutorial hasn't been updated or created. You can try to run repeat step 4 in [Contributing to Haystack Tutorials](#contributing-to-haystack-tutorials).

# Naming Convention for File Names

- Each tutorial name starts with a number. If you create a new tutorial, its name should start with the number following the last tutorial. 
- Separate words in the title with an `_` underscore.
- Use a short descriptive name for the filename, for example: *22_creating_a_summarizer_pipeline*.
- Generated markdown files only have the number of the tutorial (use the `scripts/generate_markdowns.py` script for this).
