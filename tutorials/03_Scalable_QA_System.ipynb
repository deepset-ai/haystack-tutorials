It's a fast and scalable text-focused storage option. This service runs independently from Haystack and persists even after the Haystack program has finished running. To learn more about the DocumentStore and the different types of external databases that we support, see [DocumentStore](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/document_store)."

Family, duty, and honor play major roles in conflicts that arise in the story arc, and qualities traditionally categorized as noble oppose each other in resolution. Character decision conflicts and consequence analysis are particular to how Martin wants to portray fantasy.\\n\\nMartin characteristically deviates from the traditional fantasy model and clear-cut lines of good versus evil. Martin reflects: \"I think the battle between good and evil is fought largely within the individual human heart, by the decisions that we make. It\\'s not like evil dresses up in black clothing and you know, they\\'re really ugly\". This viewpoint characterizes the book and is evident in the actions of several different families which frequently have conflicts with each other. The Starks\\' and Lannisters\\' conflict is a central component of the novel, and the reader receives points of view from both sides. Likewise, Daenerys\\' storyline develops around the Targaryen\\'s upheaval in Westeros, in which the Starks played a significant role.

Some of the changes were more well-received than others (the sexual assault scene was heavily criticized and caused great controversy). The various plotlines for the season also differed significantly in reception. The Dornish subplot received an overwhelmingly negative reception.

The various plotlines for the season also differed significantly in reception. The Dornish subplot received an overwhelmingly negative reception. In particular, the hyped Sand Snakes were maligned by critics and fans alike, as many found them cheesy and unlikeable. In contrast, Tyrion\\'s storyline was highly praised. Many fans felt that his subplot progressed overly slowly in the novels, and his meeting with Daenerys was particularly lauded.\\n\\n===Ratings===\\n\\nThe gross viewing figure per episode for the show, which include streaming, DVR recordings and repeat showings, averaged at 20 million this season.\\n\\nLive +7 ratings were not available, so Live +3 ratings have been used instead.\\n\\n\\'\\'Business Insider\\'\\' noted a significant difference in the ratings between this season and previous seasons. The typical pattern involves \"Solid premiere viewings followed by a slow but steady gain of momentum through to the finale. Historically, the finale episodes of each season have beaten the premiere for total number of viewers\". However, this season showed a significant decline from 8 million viewers at the premiere to 5.4 million at the seventh episode, \"The Gift\".

It also acknowledged a possible effect of the first four episodes leaking online before the season premiere and the decision to air on Memorial Day weekend in the United States (a weekend that had been skipped in previous seasons). \\'\\'Business Insider\\'\\' reached out to HBO for comment, HBO responded that it is seeing an increase in overall viewer numbers this season taking into account streaming services, which are not included in Nielsen ratings. The dip in ratings did not extend to the eighth and ninth episodes, \"Hardhome,\" and \"The Dance of Dragons\", which were both seen by over 7 million viewers.

Other notable divergence from the books include the modification of the whole strategy of Robb Stark when dividing his forces, and a change to the Targaryen genealogy as explained by Maester Aemon: in the TV adaptation the Mad King is described as the son, rather than the grandson, of Aegon V (thus eliminating Jaehaerys II from the succession of kings).\\n\\n===Casting===\\nSibel Kekilli plays the role of the prostitute Shae.\\n\"Baelor\" marks the first appearance of the German actress Sibel Kekilli, in the role of the prostitute Shae.

According to Martin, \"a lot of beautiful young women read for Shae. ... But there\\'s another dimension to Shae as well. She\\'s not as practiced and hardened at this as a more seasoned pro. There\\'s still a girl next door quality to her, a sense of vulnerability, playfulness, and, yes, innocence. ... All of our Shaes were hot as hell.

In many cases, such as the burning of organic matter, for example wood, or the incomplete combustion of gas, incandescent solid particles called soot produce the familiar red-orange glow of \"fire\".

Hydrogen and hydrazine/UDMH flames are similarly pale blue, while burning boron and its compounds, evaluated in mid-20th century as a high energy fuel for jet and rocket engines, emits intense green flame, leading to its informal nickname of \"Green Dragon\".\\n\\nThe glow of a flame is complex. Black-body radiation is emitted from soot, gas, and fuel particles, though the soot particles are too small to behave like perfect blackbodies. There is also photon emission by de-excited atoms and molecules in the gases. Much of the radiation is emitted in the visible and infrared bands.

In micro gravity or zero gravity, such as an environment in outer space, convection no longer occurs, and the flame becomes spherical, with a tendency to become more blue and more efficient (although it may go out if not moved steadily, as the CO2 from combustion does not disperse as readily in micro gravity, and tends to smother the flame).

There are several possible explanations for this difference, of which the most likely is that the temperature is sufficiently evenly distributed that soot is not formed and complete combustion occurs. Experiments by NASA reveal that diffusion flames in micro gravity allow more soot to be completely oxidized after they are produced than diffusion flames on Earth, because of a series of mechanisms that behave differently in micro gravity when compared to normal gravity conditions.

Evidence of cooked food is found from , although there is a theory that fire could have been used in a controlled fashion about 1 million years ago.  Evidence becomes widespread around 50 to 100 thousand years ago, suggesting regular use from this time; resistance to air pollution started to evolve in human populations at a similar point in time.  The use of fire became progressively more sophisticated, with it being used to create charcoal and to control wildlife from tens of thousands of years ago.\\n\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 13}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '704e8bdbee03dd3e72bd0a27d9edba2a'}>,\n",

These fires were typically controlled burns or \"cool fires\", as opposed to uncontrolled \"hot fires\", which damage the soil. Hot fires destroy plants and animals, and endanger communities. This is especially a problem in the forests of today where traditional burning is prevented in order to encourage the growth of timber crops. Cool fires are generally conducted in the spring and autumn. They clear undergrowth, burning up biomass that could trigger a hot fire should it get too dense.

Another human use for fire in regards to landscape management is its use to clear land for agriculture. Slash-and-burn agriculture is still common across much of tropical Africa, Asia and South America. \"For small farmers, it is a convenient way to clear overgrown areas and release nutrients from standing vegetation back into the soil\", said Miguel Pinedo-Vasquez, an ecologist at the  Earth Institute’s Center for Environmental Research and Conservation. However this useful strategy is also problematic. Growing population, fragmentation of forests and warming climate are making the earth\\'s surface more prone to ever-larger escaped fires. These harm ecosystems and human infrastructure, cause health problems, and send up spirals of carbon and soot that may encourage even more warming of the atmosphere – and thus feed back into more fires.

Varys turned to begging, prostitution, and ultimately theft to survive, but soon became known in Myr and fled to Pentos. There he befriended a poor sellsword, Illyrio Mopatis, with whom he teamed up to steal valuables from other thieves and return them to their owners for a fee. Varys eventually realised that there was more to gain from stealing secrets instead of valuables and trained his spies to copy information from the wealthy and powerful. Varys and Illyrio became rich, and Varys' reputation reached the ears of the King of Westeros, Aerys II Targaryen, who appointed Varys as his Master of Whisperers. \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 1}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '411f6808d892a1aa0739081093e19a16'}>,\n",

George R.R. Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre. Martin has stated that \"the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves.\"A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real world. Just like people\\'s capacity for good and for evil in real life, Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change. The series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies, and thus the supposed villains can provide their side of the story.

After Djawadi was shown a preliminary animated ''Game of Thrones'' title sequence that the visual effect artists were still working on, he was inspired to write the piece. He said that he started humming what would become the theme tune in the car after seeing the visuals for the title sequence, and conceived of the idea for the theme on the drive back to his studio.

The tune begins with the riff played on strings in a minor key, then changed to a major key after 2 bars, and back to minor again. Djawadi said that he wanted to reflect the \"backstabbing and conspiracy\" and the unpredictability of the show: \"... I thought it would be cool to kinda do the same play with the music.

The melody is then repeated with the entire orchestra. The next section introduces a change in melody, described by Djawadi as giving \"a sense of adventure\", and continues with a repeat that involves a choir of twenty female voices - recorded in Prague, like the instrumental parts. The title theme ends with a combination of dulcimer and kantele, producing a \"shimmery quality\" in its sound that Djawadi thought would give a sense of mystery and anticipation for the episode.\\n\\nThe title music is reprised as a global theme in the soundtracks for the series.

After crushing the Targaryen dynasty and winning the war, Robert took the Iron Throne and established the Baratheon dynasty as its first king.  However, due to Lyanna\\'s untimely death during the war, Robert instead married Tywin Lannister\\'s daughter Cersei to ensure political stability.

Though headstrong, rash and impatient, Robert can be merciful towards his enemies as long as they are honest and brave, and can inspire loyalty and friendship in even enemies via charisma alone.

For example, Nate Jones of \\'\\'Vulture\\'\\' notes, \"It\\'s easy to see what other characters\\' deaths meant for the series\\' sprawling narrative: Ned\\'s execution sent the Stark kids adrift in a universe where there was nobody looking out for them, while Robb\\'s murder was the final death knell for the hopes that the saga would ever have a traditional \\'happy\\' ending. What would be accomplished, narratively, by getting rid of Jon permanently right now?\"', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 12}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'c6fcb975e9ecc5aac9e316adfcbe4a8e'}>,\n",
