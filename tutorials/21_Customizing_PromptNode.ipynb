    "City economists expect UK inflation to have cooled for a third month running in January – the exact number is announced on Wednesday – helped by falling petrol prices and a broader decline in the global price of oil and gas in recent months. The hope now is for a sustained decline in the months ahead, continuing a steady drop from the peak of 11.1% seen in October.\n",
    "The message from the Bank of England has been clear. Inflation is on track for a “rapid” decline over the coming months, raising hopes that the worst of Britain’s cost of living crisis is now in the rearview mirror.\n",

The chart shows the view looking south-east from London at 8pm GMT on Monday, but the view will be similar every night this week.\n",

Her teammate, Ash Gardner, will earn three times that playing for the Gujarat Giants.

The NRLW made its own wage-related headlines on Tuesday, to the effect that the next (agreed in principle) collective bargaining agreement will bring with it a $1.5m salary cap in 2027, at an average salary of $62,500.
