    "City economists expect UK inflation to have cooled for a third month running in January – the exact number is announced on Wednesday – helped by falling petrol prices and a broader decline in the global price of oil and gas in recent months. The hope now is for a sustained decline in the months ahead, continuing a steady drop from the peak of 11.1% seen in October.\n",
    "The message from the Bank of England has been clear. Inflation is on track for a “rapid” decline over the coming months, raising hopes that the worst of Britain’s cost of living crisis is now in the rearview mirror.\n",
    "There are two good reasons for this. Energy costs are moving in the right direction, while the initial rise in wholesale oil and gas prices that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February last year will soon drop from the calculation of the annual inflation rate.\"\"\"\n",

The chart shows the view looking south-east from London at 8pm GMT on Monday, but the view will be similar every night this week.\n",
    "Hydra is the largest of the 88 modern constellations covering an area of 1,303 square degrees. To compare, nearby Orion only covers 594 square degrees. Hydra accounts for most of its area by its length, crossing more than 100 degrees of the sky (the full moon spans half a degree).\n",

Her teammate, Ash Gardner, will earn three times that playing for the Gujarat Giants. The allrounder’s figure of $558,000 is more than Sam Kerr pockets in a season with Chelsea and more than the WNBA’s top earner, Jackie Young.\n",
    "If that sounds like a watershed moment, it’s perhaps because it is. And it is not the only one this past week. The NRLW made its own wage-related headlines on Tuesday, to the effect that the next (agreed in principle) collective bargaining agreement will bring with it a $1.5m salary cap in 2027, at an average salary of $62,500.
