    "# Tutorial: Retrieving a Context Window Around a Sentence\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Level**: Beginner\n",
    "- **Time to complete**: 10 minutes\n",
    "- **Components Used**: [`SentenceWindowRetriever`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/sentencewindowretrieval),\n",
    "[`DocumentSplitter`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/documentsplitter), [`InMemoryDocumentStore`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/inmemorydocumentstore), [`InMemoryBM25Retriever`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/inmemorybm25retriever)\n",
    "- **Goal**: After completing this tutorial, you will have learned about Sentence-Window Retrieval and how to use it for document retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sentence-Window retrieval technique is a simple and effective way to retrieve more context given a user query which matched some document. It is based on the idea that the most relevant sentences are likely to be close to each other in the document. The technique involves selecting a window of sentences around a sentence matching a user query and instead of returning the matching sentence, the entire window is returned. This technique can be particularly useful when the user query is a question or a phrase that requires more context to be understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`SentenceWindowRetriever`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/sentencewindowretrieval) can be used in a Pipeline to implement the Sentence-Window retrieval technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "The component takes a `document_store` and a `window_size` as input. The `document_store` contains the documents we want to query, and the `window_size` is used to determine the number of sentences to return around the matching sentence. So the number of sentences returned will be `2 * window_size + 1`. Although we use the term \"sentence\" as it's inertly attached to this technique, the `SentenceWindowRetriever` actually works with any splitter from the `DocumentSplitter` class, for instance: `word`, `sentence`, `page`.\n",

The Anti-Phishing Working group reported that the number of phishing attacks against new targets was growing at a rate of 30% or more per month. Those who fall victim to these attacks can find that their bank account has been cleaned out or that their good name has been ruined by someone stealing their identity.

One important aspect to notice is that the `SentenceWindowRetriever` doesn't handle queries directly but relies on the output of another `Retriever` that handles the initial user query. This allows the `SentenceWindowRetriever` to be used in conjunction with any other retriever in the pipeline, such as the `InMemoryBM25Retriever`."
