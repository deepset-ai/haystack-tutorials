    "Evaluation is crucial for developing and deploying LLM-based systems such as RAG applications and Agents, ensuring they are accurate, reliable, and effective. It ensures the information retrieved and generated is accurate, reducing the risk of irrelevant answers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation measures performance using metrics like precision, recall, and relevancy, providing a clear picture of your pipeline's strengths and weaknesses using LLMs or ground-truth labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating RAG systems can help understand performance bottlenecks and optimize one component at a time, for example, a Retriever or a prompt used with a Generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step guide explaining what you need to evaluate, how you evaluate, and how you can improve your application after evaluation using Haystack!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Building your pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose the required components based on your use case and create your Haystack pipeline. If you‚Äôre a beginner, start with [üìö Tutorial: Creating Your First QA Pipeline with Retrieval-Augmentation](https://haystack.deepset.ai/tutorials/27_first_rag_pipeline). If you‚Äôd like to explore different model providers, vector databases, retrieval techniques, and more with Haystack, pick an example fromüßë‚Äçüç≥¬†[Haystack Cookbooks](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack-cookbook).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Human Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "As the first step, perform **manual evaluation**. Test a few queries (5-10 queries) and manually assess the accuracy, relevance, coherence, format, and overall quality of your pipeline‚Äôs output. This will provide an initial understanding of how well your system performs and highlight any obvious issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "To trace the data through each pipeline step, debug the intermediate components using the [include_outputs_from](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/reference/pipeline-api#pipelinerun) parameter. This feature is particularly useful for observing the retrieved documents or verifying the rendered prompt. By examining these intermediate outputs, you can pinpoint where issues may arise and identify specific areas for improvement, such as tweaking the prompt or trying out different models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Deciding on Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation metrics are crucial for measuring the effectiveness of your pipeline. Common metrics are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Semantic Answer Similarity**: Evaluates the semantic similarity of the generated answer and the ground truth rather than their lexical overlap.\n",
    "- **Context Relevancy**: Assesses the relevance of the retrieved documents to the query.\n",
    "- **Faithfulness:** Evaluates to what extent a generated answer is based on retrieved documents\n",
    "- **Context Precision**: Measures the accuracy of the retrieved documents.\n",
    "- **Context Recall**: Measures the ability to retrieve all relevant documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some metrics might require labeled data, while others can be evaluated using LLMs without needing labeled data. As you evaluate your pipeline, explore various types of metrics, such as [statistical](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/statistical-evaluation) and [model-based](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/model-based-evaluation) metrics, or incorporate custom metrics using LLMs with the [LLMEvaluator](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/llmevaluator). \n",

    "\n",
    "## 5. Running Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of running evaluations is to measure your pipeline's performance and detect any regressions. To track progress, it is essential to establish baseline metrics using off-the-shelf approaches such as BM25 for keyword retrieval or \"sentence-transformers\" models for embeddings. Then, continue evaluating your pipeline with various parameters: adjust the `top_k` value, experiment with different embedding models, tweak the `temperature`, and benchmark the results to identify what works best for your use case. If labeled data is needed for evaluation, you can use datasets that include ground-truth documents and answers. Such datasets are available on [Hugging Face datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets) or in the [haystack-evaluation](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack-evaluation/tree/main/datasets) repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure your evaluation environment is set up to facilitate easy testing with different parameters. The [haystack-evaluation](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack-evaluation) repository provides examples with various architectures against different datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on optimizing your pipeline by experimenting with different parameter combinations, refer to üìö¬†[Article: Benchmarking Haystack Pipelines for Optimal Performance](https://haystack.deepset.ai/blog/benchmarking-haystack-pipelines).\n",

    "## 6. Analyzing Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualize your data and your results to have a general understanding of your pipeline‚Äôs performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a report using [EvaluationRunResult.score_report()](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/reference/evaluation-api#evaluationrunresult) and transform the evaluation results into a Pandas DataFrame with the aggregated scores for each metric:\n",

    "\n",
    "- Use Pandas to analyze the results for different parameters (`top_k`, `batch_size`, `embedding_model`) in a comprehensive view\n",
    "- Use libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to visually represent your evaluation results.\n",
    "    \n",

    "## 7. Improving Your Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "After evaluation, analyze the results to identify areas of improvement. Here are some methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods to Improve Retrieval:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Cleaning**: Ensure your data is clean and well-structured before indexing using [DocumentCleaner](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/documentcleaner) and [DocumentSplitter](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/documentsplitter).\n",
    "- **Data Quality:** Enrich the semantics of your documents by [embedding meaningful metadata](https://haystack.deepset.ai/tutorials/39_embedding_metadata_for_improved_retrieval) alongside the document's contents.\n",
    "- **Metadata Filtering**: Limit the search space by using [metadata filters](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/metadata-filtering) or extracting metadata from queries to use as filters. For more details, read üìö [Extract Metadata from Queries to Improve Retrieval](https://haystack.deepset.ai/blog/extracting-metadata-filter).\n",
    "- **Different Embedding Models:** Compare different embedding models from different model providers. See the full list of supported embedding providers in [Embedders](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/embedders).\n",
    "- **Advanced Retrieval Techniques**: Leverage techniques like [hybrid retrieval](https://haystack.deepset.ai/tutorials/33_hybrid_retrieval), [sparse embeddings](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/retrievers#sparse-embedding-based-retrievers), or [Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HYDE)](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/hypothetical-document-embeddings-hyde).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods to Improve Generation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ranking**: Incorporate a ranking mechanism into your retrieved documents before providing the context to your prompt\n",
    "    - **Order by similarity**: Reorder your retrieved documents by similarity using cross-encoder models from Hugging Face with [TransformersSimilarityRanker](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/transformerssimilarityranker), Rerank models from Cohere with [CohereRanker](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/cohereranker), or Rerankers from Jina with [JinaRanker](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/jinaranker)\n",
    "    - **Increase diversity by ranking**: Maximize the overall diversity among your context using sentence-transformers models with [SentenceTransformersDiversityRanker](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/sentencetransformersdiversityranker) to help increase the semantic answer similarity (SAS) in LFQA applications.\n",
    "    - **Address the \"Lost in the Middle\" problem by reordering**: Position the most relevant documents at the beginning and end of the context using [LostInTheMiddleRanker](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/lostinthemiddleranker) to increase faithfulness.\n",
    "- **Different Generators**: Try different large language models and benchmark the results. The full list of model providers is in [Generators](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/generators).\n",
    "- **Prompt Engineering**: Use few-shot prompts or provide more instructions to enable the exact match.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement strategies for [tracing](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/tracing) the application post-deployment. By integrating [LangfuseConnector](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/langfuseconnector) into your pipeline, you can collect the queries, documents, and answers and use them to continuously evaluate your application. Learn more about pipeline monitoring in üìö [Article: Monitor and trace your Haystack pipelines with Langfuse](https://haystack.deepset.ai/blog/langfuse-integration)."
