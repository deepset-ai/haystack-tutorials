    "For many use cases it is sufficient to just use one of the existing public models that were trained on SQuAD or other public QA datasets (e.g. Natural Questions).\n",
    "However, if you have domain-specific questions, fine-tuning your model on custom examples will very likely boost your performance.\n",

    "1. **Annotation**: You can use the [annotation tool](https://haystack.deepset.ai/guides/annotation) to label your data, i.e. highlighting answers to your questions in a document. The tool supports structuring your workflow with organizations, projects, and users. The labels can be exported in SQuAD format that is compatible for training with Haystack.\n",

    "2. **Feedback**: For production systems, you can collect training data from direct user feedback via Haystack's [REST API interface](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack#rest-api). This includes a customizable user feedback API for providing feedback on the answer returned by the API. The API provides a feedback export endpoint to obtain the feedback data for fine-tuning your model further.\n",
