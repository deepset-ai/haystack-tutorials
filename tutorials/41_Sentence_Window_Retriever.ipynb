    "The Sentence-Window retrieval technique is a simple and effective way to retrieve more context given a user query which matched some document. It is based on the idea that the most relevant sentences are likely to be close to each other in the document. The technique involves selecting a window of sentences around a sentence matching a user query and instead of returning the matching sentence, the entire window is returned. This technique can be particularly useful when the user query is a question or a phrase that requires more context to be understood."

The document_store contains the documents we want to query, and the window_size is used to determine the number of sentences to return around the matching sentence. So the number of sentences returned will be `2 * window_size + 1`. Although we use the term \"sentence\" as it's inertly attached to this technique, the `SentenceWindowRetriever` actually works with any splitter from the `DocumentSplitter` class, for instance: `word`, `sentence`, `page`."

       "'\"  In particular, phishing attacks, which typically use fake versions of bank websites to grab login details of customers, boomed during 2004. Web portal Lycos Europe reported a 500% increase in the number of phishing e-mail messages it was catching. The Anti-Phishing Working group reported that the number of phishing attacks against new targets was growing at a rate of 30% or more per month. Those who fall victim to these attacks can find that their bank account has been cleaned out or that their good name has been ruined by someone stealing their identity. This change in the ranks of virus writers could mean the end of the mass-mailing virus which attempts to spread by tricking people into opening infected attachments on e-mail messages.'"

    "We saw how the `SentenceWindowRetriever` works and how it can be used to retrieve a window of sentences around a matching document, give us more context to understand the document. One important aspect to notice is that the `SentenceWindowRetriever` doesn't handle queries directly but relies on the output of another `Retriever` that handles the initial user query. This allows the `SentenceWindowRetriever` to be used in conjunction with any other retriever in the pipeline, such as the `InMemoryBM25Retriever`."
