    "Learn how you can interact with Haystack through REST API. This tutorial introduces you to all the concepts needed to build an end-to-end document search application.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With Haystack, you can apply the latest NLP technology to your own data and create production-ready applications. Building an end-to-end NLP application requires the combination of multiple concepts:\n",
    "* **DocumentStore** is the component in Haystack responsible for loading and storing text data in the form of [Documents](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/documents_answers_labels#document). In this tutorial, the DocumentStore uses Elasticsearch behind the scene.\n",
    "* **Haystack pipelines** convert files into Documents, index them to the DocumentStore, and run NLP tasks such as question answering and document search.\n",
    "* **REST API**, as a concept, makes it possible for applications to interact with each other by handling their queries and returning responses. There is `rest_api` application within Haystack that exposes Haystack's functionalities through a RESTful API.\n",
    "* **Docker** simplifies the environment setup needed to run Elasticsearch and Haystack API.\n",
    "\n",
    "> You can find ready-made base files (*document-search.haystack-pipeline.yml* and *docker-compose.yml*) for this tutorial in the [document-search-demo](https://github.com/bilgeyucel/document-search-demo) repository. After following the instructions in the repository, you can proceed directly to the ['Indexing Files to Elasticsearch'](#indexing-files-to-elasticsearch) section of this tutorial and begin indexing your documents."

    "## Creating the Pipeline YAML File\n",
    "\n",
    "You can define components and pipelines using YAML code that Haystack translates into Python objects. In a pipeline YAML file, the `components` section lists all pipeline nodes and the `pipelines` section defines how these nodes are connected to each other. Let's start with defining two different pipelines, one to index your documents and another one to query them. We'll use one YAML file to define both pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a document search pipeline. This will be your query pipeline:\n",
    "   1. In the newly created *doc-search* folder, create a file named *document-search.haystack-pipeline.yml*. The *docker-compose.yml* file and the new pipeline YAML file should be on the same level in the directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      /doc-search\n",
    "      ├── docker-compose.yml\n",
    "      └── document-search.haystack-pipeline.yml\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Provide the path to *document-search.haystack-pipeline.yml* as the `volume` source value in the *docker-compose.yml* file. The path must be relative to *docker-compose.yml*. As both files are in the same directory, the source value will be `./`. \n",
    "\n",
    "      ```yaml\n",
    "      haystack-api:\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "        volumes:\n",
    "          - ./:/opt/pipelines\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. Update the `PIPELINE_YAML_PATH` variable in *docker-compose.yml* with the name of the pipeline YAML file. The `PIPELINE_YAML_PATH` variable tells `rest_api` which YAML file to run. \n",
    "\n",
    "      ```yaml\n",
    "      environment:\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "        - PIPELINE_YAML_PATH=/opt/pipelines/document-search.haystack-pipeline.yml\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "   4. Define the pipeline nodes in the `components` section of the file. A document search pipeline requires a DocumentStore and a Retriever. Our pipeline will use `ElasticsearchDocumentStore` and `EmbeddingRetriever`:\n",
    "\n",
    "      ```yaml\n",
    "      components:\n",
    "        - name: DocumentStore # How you want to call this node here\n",

    "          params:\n",

    "            embedding_model: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   5. Create a query pipeline in the `pipelines` section. Here, `name` refers to the name of the pipeline, and `nodes` defines the order of the nodes in the pipeline: \n",
    "\n",
    "      ```yaml\n",
    "      pipelines:\n",
    "        - name: query \n",
    "          nodes:\n",

    "              inputs: [Query]\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the same YAML file, create an indexing pipeline. This pipeline will index your documents to Elasticsearch through `rest_api`. \n",
    "   1. Define `FileTypeClassifier`, `TextConverter`, and `PreProcessor` nodes for the pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "      ```yaml\n",
    "      components:\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "        - name: FileTypeClassifier\n",
    "          type: FileTypeClassifier\n",
    "        - name: TextFileConverter\n",
    "          type: TextConverter\n",
    "        - name: Preprocessor\n",
    "          type: PreProcessor\n",
    "          params: # These parameters define how you want to split your documents\n",

    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. In the `pipelines` section of the YAML file, create a new pipeline called `indexing`. In this pipeline, indicate how the nodes you just defined are connected to each other, Retriever, and DocumentStore. This indexing pipeline supports *.TXT* files and preprocesses them before loading to Elasticsearch.\n",
